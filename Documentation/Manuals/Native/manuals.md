# Developer guides

Here you will find a list of all manuals relating to Banshee's native code, primarily focusing on explaining the engine internals instead of the user-facing code. The manuals are roughly ordered in the way they should be read, although if you are interested in a specific topic feel free to skip ahead as manuals often contain cross references to prerequisite manuals.

## General guides
Name                                      | Description
------------------------------------------|-------------
[Getting started](@ref gettingStarted)    | Shows how to perform some basic operations using Banshee's user-facing interface. Allows you to get a general idea of how Banshee works.
[Architecture](@ref architecture)         | Gives you an overview of the entire architecture of Banshee. Useful starting point for those modifying engine internals as it provides a way to identify major systems.
[Utilities](@ref utilities)               | Provides an overview of a variety of utility systems used throughout Banshee.
[Core thread](@ref coreThread)            | Explains how core (rendering) thread works, how it interacts with simulation thread, what are core objects and how to create your own.
[Resources](@ref resources)  			  | Explains how resources work, including saving, loading and creating brand new resource types.
[RTTI](@ref rtti)                         | Shows you how to add run-time type information for your objects.
[Game objects](@ref gameObjects)          | Explains what are scene objects and components and how can you use them to create your scene.
[Scripting](@ref scripting)               | Shows you how to interact with the scripting system, and how to expose C++ objects to the scripting API.
[Renderer](@ref renderer)    	  		  | Explains how the renderer works on the low level, and how to create a custom renderer so you may fully customize the look of your application.
[BSLFX](@ref bslfx)    	  		  		  | Provides a reference for the Banshee Shading Language FX syntax.
[Custom GUI elements](@ref customGUI)     | Shows you how to create custom GUI elements, manually render text or modify GUI system in a general way.
[Custom importers](@ref customImporters)  | Shows you how to create importers that handle conversion of third party resources into engine ready formats.
[Custom plugins](@ref customPlugins)      | Shows you how to create custom plugins that can be loaded by Banshee.
[Quick reference](@ref quickref)          | Provides a few bits of commonly required information, that might be hard to remember otherwise.
[Porting](@ref porting)                   | Information about how to go on about porting Banshee to a different operating system.
[Code style](@ref style)                  | Information about code style used when writing Banshee.
