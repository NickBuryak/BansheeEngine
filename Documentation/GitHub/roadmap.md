# Roadmap

[Detailed task list] (https://trello.com/b/w6CyYY37/banshee-3d)

We are currently focusing on finish up a final set of features before releasing 1.0 stable. These features are:
 - Physically based renderer
 - Linux/Mac ports

Planned for Q2 2017 release

---------------------------------------------------

There are many more features planned, but these are without a specific timeline or order:
 - Mobile render API (likely Vulkan, possibly Metal for iOS)
 - Android/iOS/WP ports
 - High level networking (replication, RPCs)
 - Dynamic global illumination (+ other high fidelity graphical improvements)
 - Occlussion culling
 - Terrain
 - Effects/Particle editor
 - AI (pathfinding, navmesh)
 - VR support
 - Cinematics editor
 - Unified shading language
 - Visual shader editor
 - More specialized editor tools for 2D games
 - Script debugging
 - Level of detail
 - XBONE/PS4 ports
 - BSP brushes for level prototyping
 - Offline lightmapper
 - And more to be decided later...
 
Implementation times for each of those roughly ranges from 1-4 months.

More contributors mean we can add more of these features quicker. Consider contributing!
